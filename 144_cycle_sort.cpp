// CYCLE SORT: When given numbers from range 1 to N, we use cyclic sort. Using this, we can sort the array in a single pass, which gives us a time complexity of O(N). We start from the first index and check if it is at its correct position (as the array contains elements from 1 to N, correct position of each element will be at index 'element-1'), and if its not, we keep swapping it with element at our current element's correct position, till we have 1 at first index, then we move to next element and do the same till the we reach the last element.
